# TodoFetchAPI

Basically same program as the movies project earlier, but using single page.

I find using javascript like this in a different file and then injecting it in the page, so you have a separation of code, a bit better than normal frameworks like react and angular. But at the same time it feels a bit clunky?
In anyway, MVC now feels like it's own thing. I don't know how blazor makes this even better, but this is very good!
